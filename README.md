Analysing the Wine Quality Dataset (Red and White Wine) with Python

**Wine Quality Dataset Analysis with Python**

🅾🆅🅴🆁🆅🅸🅴🆆

This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for analyzing the Wine Quality Dataset. The dataset consists of two separate datasets, one for red wine and one for white wine, each with various chemical properties and a quality rating. The goal of this analysis is to explore the data, perform data preprocessing, and build predictive models to predict wine quality based on its features.

1. We can see a positive relation to quality with alcohol
2. Red wine has higer avearge quality than white wine.
3. Sweeter wines recived higher average rating by 0.01 more.
4. Wines with higher alcohol content received higher rating.
5. Alcohol have higher importance value and have a greater impact on wine quality predictions.
